## Overview

An overview is required for each code example, to both explain the potential use case for the code as well as describe how the code functions at a high-level. Try to keep it to a few sentences if possible. The goal of this resource isn't for Hitchhikers to simply copy and paste, but to understand the function of the code they are using.

## Instructions

Here you can input the relavent code. Be mindful not to include extraneous facets or lines.

```css
.HitchhikerCTA {
    border-radius: 30px;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    background: linear-gradient(to right, #1b64b9 50%, #fff 50%);
    background-size: 200% 100%;
}
```
Here you can re-iterate what the code achieves.
