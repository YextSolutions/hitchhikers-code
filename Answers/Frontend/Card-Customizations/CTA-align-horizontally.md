The below code will allow you to align two CTAs horizontally on a card. 

```css
.HitchhikerFaqAccordion-ctasWrapper {
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
    display: flex;
}
```

We recommend you test this on mobile though, and make sure itâ€™s appearing as desired. You might want to make sure the CTAs are ```flex-direction: column ``` on smaller breakpoints.
