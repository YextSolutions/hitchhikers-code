This is a solution for how to create differnet link behaviors for entities within a vertical. In other words, you may want CTAs links to behave differently across an entity type. This requires an innovative solution, as link behavior is set at the card level.

While there is not currenlty an obvious solution, you can find a workaround by utilizing the 2nd (and 3rd) CTA fields to define different link behavior. For example, you can assign  _top behavior to the Primary CTA and _blank behavior to the Secondary CTA. You could then populate your CTA in the corresponding CTA fields in the Knowledge Graph to achieve the desired link behavior.  

*Please note that this solution only worked becuase the 2nd and 3rd CTAs were not otherwise utilized within the FAQ vertical.*
