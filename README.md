## Welcome

Welcome to the Hitchhikers Code Bank! Use this as a resource to easily search code examples shared by your fellow Hitchhikers. Search the repository here: https://hh-code-repository.sbx.pagescdn.com/!

## Style Guide
Each resource in this repository should conform to the following style rules:

### Metadata
The information in the first few lines of each resource help us to power the Answers search. It's important that these are filled out so we can power the cards in the Code Bank search experience.

To add this to your file, you can copy the markdown below and adjust the values to represent your resource. **Name, Date Updated, Product, and Categories are required**.

### Formatting
We use Markdown to format the resources in this repository. For a full guide on Github-supported markdown, please see here: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

### Structure
Include an **Introduction** section to explain to a user why this resource may be useful to them. The introduction can be used to describe different use cases, link to additional reading materials, and give a brief overview of the instructions.

Afterwards, include an **Instructions** section to walk a user through the steps to implement. This should leverage code blocks and images where helpful to give a user a clear understanding of what they should do and most importantly, *why*.
